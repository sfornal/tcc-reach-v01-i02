			<p>As part of their commitment to foster a college-going culture, TCC Southeast Campus and Arlington ISD joined together at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 22, 2014 to open TCCâ€™s new Tarrant County College Southeast/Arlington ISD Collegiate High School. The 30,000-square-foot Early College High School (ECHS) includes nine classrooms, two science laboratories and one computer laboratory. It also includes a learning resource center, a 400-seat cafeteria/ auditorium, administrative offices and 250 parking spaces.</p>

			<p>Each fall a maximum of 125 freshmen will be enrolled until the capacity of 500 students is reached in 2018, when this inaugural class of students who meet requirements will graduate with both their high school diplomas and associate degrees.</p>

			<h3>Heading</h3>

			<p>Sidebar contents go here.</p>

			<p>Use a level 3 (&lt;h3&gt;) heading as the main heading, and use level 4 or 5 as sub- or sub-subheadings, as needed.</p>

			<p>Use an &lt;hr&gt; to add a line divider.</p>

			<p>Use the <strong>Mag-Sidebar-Divider</strong> snippet to make a second sidebar.</p>

			<p>To place an image in the sidebar, simply use a normal image element; the <em>figure snippet</em> is not needed.</p>
